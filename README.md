# agGridDemo

## Intro 
**agGrid** is a fully-fledged and highly customizable JavaScript data grid. It delivers outstanding features (like sorting, filtering, etc), performance, and rich data display (simple and complex). Interestingly, it also gives a smooth integration with Angular as well.

Why leverage on ag-Grid:
- [x] Column Grouping
- [x] Column Moving
- [x] Column Pinning
- [x] Column Resizing
- [x] Column and Text Filtering
- [x] Row Selection
- [x] Row Sorting
- [x] Row Dragging
- [x] Cell Styling
- [x] Touch Support and
- [x] Many more...

This demo is a play-around to exploring the nitty-gritty of this agGrid.
